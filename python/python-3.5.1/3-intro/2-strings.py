# Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character 
# having index 0. There is no separate character type; 
# a character is simply a string of size one:
word = 'Python'
word[0] # character in position 0
word[5] # character in position 5
# Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right:
word[-1] # last character
word[-2] # second-last character
word[-6]
# Note that since -0 is the same as 0, negative indices start from -1.
# In addition to indexing, slicing is also supported. 
# While indexing is used to obtain individual characters, 
# slicing allows you to obtain substring:
word[0:2] # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)
word[2:5] # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)
# Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded.
# This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s :
word[:2] + word[2:]
word[:4] + word[4:]
# Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults #to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.
word[:2] # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded)
word[4:] # characters from position 4 (included) to the end
word[-2:] # characters from the second-last (included) to the end
# the length of word[1:3] is 2.
# Attempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error:
word[42] # the word only has 6 characters
# However, out of range slice indexes are handled 
# gracefully when used for slicing:
word[4:42]
word[42:]
# Python strings cannot be changed — they are immutable.
# Therefore, assigning to an indexedposition in the string results
# in an error:
word[0] = 'J'
word[2:] = 'py'
# If you need a different string, you should create a new one:
'J' + word[1:]
word[:2] + 'py'
# The built-in function len() returns the length of a string:
s = 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'
len(s)
