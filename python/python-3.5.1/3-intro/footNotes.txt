[1] Since ** has higher precedence than - , -3**2 will be 
interpreted as -(3**2) and thus result in -9 . 
To avoid this and get 9 , you can use (-3)**2 .

[2] Unlike other languages, special characters such as \n have 
the same meaning with both single ( '...' ) and double ( "..." ) quotes. 
The only difference between the two is that within single quotes 
you donâ€™t need to escape " (but you have to escape \' ) and vice versa.
