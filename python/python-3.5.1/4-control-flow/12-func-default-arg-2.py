# The default values are evaluated at the point of function definition 
# in the defining scope, so that

i = 5

def f(arg = i):
    print(arg)

i = 6
f()

# will print 5 .

# Important warning: The default value is evaluated only once.
# This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object such as
# a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. For example, the
# following function accumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:

def f(a, L = []):
    L.append(a)
    return L

print(f(1))
print(f(2))
print(f(3))

# If you donâ€™t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls,
# you can write the function like this instead:

def f(a, L = None):
    if L is None:
        L = []
    L.append(a)
    return L
