        <h2>Intermezzo: Coding Style</h2>
        <p>Now that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Python, it is a good time to talk about coding style. Most languages can be written (or more concise, formatted ) in different styles; some are more readable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that.</p>
        <p>For Python, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008">PEP 8</a> has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.</p> 
                <p>4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.</p>
                <p>This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When possible, put comments on a line of their own.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use docstrings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4) .</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use CamelCase for classes and lower_case_with_underscores for functions and methods. Always use self as the name for the first method argument (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/classes.html#tut-firstclasses">A First Look at Classes</a> for more on classes and methods).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
